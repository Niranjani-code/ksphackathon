Project Description:

This project, named "KSP (Placeholder Encryption and Face Recognition)", aims to enhance data security and access control through advanced techniques such as face recognition and two-factor authentication (2FA) using HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) and Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP). Additionally, the project utilizes Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms for generating and managing placeholders, ensuring the privacy and integrity of sensitive data.

Key Features:

- *Face Recognition*: Utilizes facial recognition technology to authenticate users before granting access to sensitive data or functionalities.

- *Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)*: Implements both HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) and Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for additional layers of security.

- *Placeholder Encryption*: Employs Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithms to generate and manage placeholders, ensuring data privacy and integrity.
-Technologies Used:

- Python
- OpenCV (for face recognition)
- speakeasy (for generating HOTP and TOTP codes)
- TensorFlow (for RNNÂ implementation)
